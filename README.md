# Final Year Project
This repository stores all files related to the artefact for my final year project. It will be a VR application focused on helping people navigate their surroundings, developed in Unreal Engine 5.

## Repository Branches
### main
- The 'main' branch should never have work committed to it directly. Any work in the main branch is expected to be merged from another branch, most likely 'development', but it is possible for work to be merged from 'demo' up until mid/late December 2023
    - Only files such as a README can be committed directly
- Only contains stable builds

### development
- The 'development' branch is where all work on the main project to be submitted takes place
- Unstable builds **are** allowed here, but only stable versions of this branch can be merged into main and demo
- No superlinter

### demo
- The 'demo' branch holds the content to be shown in the Progress Meeting demo on 14/12/2023.
- While this is being prepared, work will be done in development, and stable builds will be merged from it into this branch.
